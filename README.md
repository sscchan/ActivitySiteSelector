# ActivitySiteSelector
## Introduction
This is a Proof of Concept fullstack application that select/filters out locations for adventure activities based on weather forecast information (maximum forecasted temperature). 

## Assumptions
These assumptions are derived from the volunteer position advertisement and organisation website (thebreak.org.au).

### Traffic and System Scaling
* The description indicates that the organisation currently have 40 volunteers across 12 projects. It is presumed that no more than 5 outdoor therapy guides will using the software at a time. Traffic will be concentrated around Australian waking hours.

### Organisation Capabilities
* The description indicates the presence of an IT manager, indicating some ability for the organisation to provide capability to maintain the system after it is built.

### Resource Constraints
* The organisation is a not-for-profit charity (total income 13.4k, source acnc.gov.au) , and thus is likely to have limited financial resources for system maintenance and support.

## Level of Effort Estimates
* The volunteer description included a commitment time of less than 6 months @ 5 - 10 hrs per week.  This is equivalent to `6 * 4.34 * (5 or 10) / 8 = 16.3 to 32.5 engineer-days`, a not unreasonable estimate.
